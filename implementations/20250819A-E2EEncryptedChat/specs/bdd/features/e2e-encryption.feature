# E2E Encryption BDD Scenarios

Feature: End-to-End Encryption
  As a security-conscious user
  I want my messages to be encrypted end-to-end
  So that only the intended recipient can read them

  Background:
    Given Alice and Bob are registered users
    And they have generated their identity key pairs
    And they have completed the initial key exchange

  Scenario: Successful encrypted message exchange
    Given Alice has established a secure session with Bob
    When Alice sends the message "Hello Bob, this is confidential!" to Bob
    Then Bob receives an encrypted message
    And Bob can decrypt and read "Hello Bob, this is confidential!"
    And the message on the network is encrypted and unreadable
    And the message uses AES-256-GCM encryption

  Scenario: Message integrity verification
    Given Alice has sent an encrypted message to Bob
    When a man-in-the-middle attempts to modify the ciphertext
    Then Bob's client detects the tampering
    And Bob receives an authentication failure error
    And the tampered message is rejected

  Scenario: Perfect Forward Secrecy protection
    Given Alice and Bob have exchanged 5 messages over time
    And their session keys have been rotated multiple times
    When an attacker compromises the current session key
    Then the attacker cannot decrypt any of the previous 5 messages
    And the attacker cannot decrypt future messages after key rotation

  Scenario: Key exchange with potential MITM detection
    Given Alice attempts to start a conversation with Bob
    And there is a man-in-the-middle attacker intercepting communications
    When Alice and Bob exchange keys through the compromised channel
    Then both Alice and Bob see different safety numbers
    And the system warns about potential man-in-the-middle attack
    And the connection is marked as unverified until manual verification

Feature: User Authentication
  As a user
  I want secure authentication to protect my account
  So that unauthorized parties cannot access my messages

  Background:
    Given the secure chat application is running
    And user accounts are configured with strong authentication

  Scenario: Multi-factor authentication login
    Given a user "alice@example.com" is registered with 2FA enabled
    When the user enters the correct password "MySecureP@ssw0rd123!"
    Then the system prompts for a TOTP code
    When the user enters a valid TOTP code "123456"
    Then the user is successfully authenticated
    And receives a secure session token

  Scenario: Password complexity enforcement
    Given a new user is registering an account
    When the user attempts to set password "123456"
    Then the system rejects the password
    And displays "Password must be at least 12 characters with complexity requirements"
    When the user sets password "MySecureP@ssw0rd123!"
    Then the password is accepted

  Scenario: Device authentication for unknown device
    Given a user has registered from a known device
    When the user attempts to log in from a new device
    Then the system generates a unique device fingerprint
    And requests additional verification via email or SMS
    And the new device is not trusted until verification is complete

  Scenario: TOTP code expiration
    Given a user has TOTP authentication enabled
    When the user enters a TOTP code that is more than 30 seconds old
    Then the system rejects the authentication
    And displays "TOTP code expired or invalid"

Feature: Security Verification
  As a security-conscious user
  I want to verify the identity of my communication partners
  So that I can detect man-in-the-middle attacks

  Background:
    Given Alice and Bob have established an encrypted session
    And both users are security-conscious

  Scenario: Safety number verification
    Given Alice and Bob are in an encrypted chat session
    When Alice requests to verify Bob's identity
    Then both Alice and Bob see the same 60-digit safety number
    And a QR code is generated containing the safety number
    And Alice can scan Bob's QR code to verify out-of-band
    When Alice confirms the safety numbers match
    Then Bob's contact is marked as "Verified" in Alice's contact list

  Scenario: Security status indication
    Given Alice has sent an encrypted message to Bob
    When Bob views the message in the chat interface
    Then the message displays a green lock icon
    And the chat header shows "End-to-End Encrypted with Bob"
    And the security level is marked as "High"

  Scenario: Unverified contact warning
    Given Alice is chatting with Bob
    And Bob's identity has not been verified
    When Alice views the chat interface
    Then a yellow warning icon is displayed
    And the status shows "Unverified - Tap to verify Bob's identity"
    And Alice sees a recommendation to "Verify contact identity"

  Scenario: Session security degradation
    Given Alice and Bob have a verified encrypted session
    When Bob's public key changes (potential key substitution attack)
    Then Alice receives a security warning
    And the session is marked as "Identity Changed - Verify Again"
    And all messages show a red warning icon until re-verification

Feature: Data Protection
  As a privacy-focused user
  I want my local data to be encrypted
  So that my messages are protected even if my device is compromised

  Background:
    Given the user has the secure chat application installed
    And local storage encryption is enabled

  Scenario: Local message storage encryption
    Given the user has received several encrypted messages
    When the messages are stored locally on the device
    Then all messages are encrypted using SQLCipher
    And a device-specific encryption key is used
    And the database file cannot be read without the key

  Scenario: Secure memory management
    Given encryption keys are loaded into memory for message processing
    When the keys are no longer needed
    Then the memory containing the keys is zeroed immediately
    And secure memory allocations are used where available
    And sensitive data is not written to swap files

  Scenario: Message key destruction after use
    Given Alice sends a message to Bob
    And the message uses an ephemeral message key
    When the message is successfully encrypted and sent
    Then the message key is immediately destroyed
    And the destroyed key cannot be recovered from memory
    And a new key is generated for the next message

Feature: Accessibility and Usability
  As a user with accessibility needs
  I want the security features to be accessible
  So that I can use the secure chat application effectively

  Background:
    Given the user is using assistive technologies
    And the secure chat application supports accessibility

  Scenario: Screen reader security status announcements
    Given a user is using a screen reader
    When the user navigates to an encrypted chat
    Then the screen reader announces "End-to-end encrypted conversation with Bob"
    And security warnings are properly announced
    And safety number verification process is accessible via keyboard navigation

  Scenario: High contrast security indicators
    Given a user with visual impairments is using high contrast mode
    When viewing encrypted messages
    Then security indicators use high contrast colors
    And encrypted messages have sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 ratio)
    And security warnings are visually distinct

  Scenario: Keyboard navigation for security features
    Given a user relies on keyboard navigation
    When accessing security verification features
    Then all security functions are accessible via keyboard shortcuts
    And "Ctrl+E" opens the identity verification dialog
    And "Ctrl+Shift+D" securely deletes message history
    And focus indicators are clearly visible

Feature: Performance and Scalability
  As a user sending various types of messages
  I want encryption to be fast and reliable
  So that communication remains smooth

  Background:
    Given the encryption system is optimized for performance
    And quality metrics are being monitored

  Scenario: Fast message encryption
    Given Alice wants to send a 1MB message to Bob
    When Alice encrypts and sends the message
    Then the encryption completes in less than 50ms
    And the message is transmitted successfully
    And Bob receives the message within 200ms (same region)

  Scenario: Concurrent user support
    Given the system needs to support multiple simultaneous users
    When 1000 users send messages simultaneously
    Then all messages are encrypted and delivered successfully
    And the system maintains response times under 500ms
    And no encryption keys are compromised due to concurrency

  Scenario: Key rotation performance
    Given a long-running chat session between Alice and Bob
    When the system performs automatic key rotation every 100 messages
    Then key rotation completes within 500ms
    And chat functionality remains uninterrupted during rotation
    And all subsequent messages use the new keys

Feature: Error Handling and Recovery
  As a user experiencing network or system issues
  I want graceful error handling for encryption failures
  So that I can understand and resolve security issues

  Background:
    Given users may experience various network and system conditions
    And robust error handling is implemented

  Scenario: Network interruption during key exchange
    Given Alice and Bob are performing initial key exchange
    When the network connection is interrupted mid-exchange
    Then both clients detect the incomplete exchange
    And the system prompts to retry key exchange
    And no partial or insecure keys are stored

  Scenario: Corrupted message recovery
    Given Alice receives a message with corrupted data
    When the decryption process detects the corruption
    Then an "Unable to decrypt message" notification is shown
    And Alice can request message resend from Bob
    And the system logs the decryption failure for debugging

  Scenario: Device sync after offline period
    Given Alice has been offline for several hours
    And Bob sent encrypted messages during Alice's offline period
    When Alice comes back online
    Then all offline messages are properly decrypted
    And message ordering is maintained
    And any missed key rotations are properly handled
